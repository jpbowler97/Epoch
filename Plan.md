# Implementation Plan: Path to Production System

## End State Vision

The target end state is defined in Assignment.md:

> **Success**: Being able to replicate the "Data" section at https://epoch.ai/data-insights/models-over-1e25-flop by automatically scraping information from publicly available sources, with the ability to manually intervene to correct issues / add more models through a well-defined, contractor-manageable process.

## Current Foundation

We have built a solid foundation with:
- Comprehensive data schema and storage system
- Two complementary scrapers (Hugging Face + ChatBot Arena) covering 75+ models
- FLOP estimation using multiple methods (scaling laws + benchmark-based)
- Advanced query engine with CSV export capabilities
- Unified data refresh entry point

## Gap Analysis: Current vs. Target

### What We Have
- **Automated Data Collection**: 75+ models from complementary sources
- **FLOP Estimation**: Multiple methods with confidence levels
- **Data Export**: CSV files with complete metadata
- **CLI Tools**: Query and filtering capabilities

### What We Need for Production
1. **Complete Coverage**: Replicate all models from Epoch's tracker
2. **Data Validation**: Cross-validation against existing Epoch data
3. **Manual Override System**: Contractor-friendly interface for corrections
4. **Production Reliability**: Error handling, monitoring, scheduled updates
5. **Quality Assurance**: Systematic accuracy validation

## Implementation Roadmap

**Priority 1: Epoch Data Validation & Gap Analysis**
- **Goal**: Systematic comparison against Epoch's existing tracker
- **Deliverables**:
  - Manually validate data vs Epoch's data here https://epoch.ai/data-insights/models-over-1e25-flop
  - Gap analysis report identifying missing models
  - Identify ways to close the gap
  - Accuracy assessment with confidence intervals
- **Success Criteria**: 90%+ coverage of models in Epoch's tracker

**Priority 2: Manual Override System**
- **Goal**: Contractor-friendly interface for corrections and additions
- **Deliverables**:
  - Manual entry interface (should be done by directly editing a csv file with the data)
  - Data correction workflows with audit trails
  - Template-based model addition process
  - Quality validation for manual entries
  - Clear distinction between what has been added / edited manually vs added by the scrapers
  - This may also require manually copying and pasting in data from urls which our scrapers cannot access programmatically
- **Success Criteria**: Non-technical contractor can add/correct models in <10 minutes

**Priority 3: Enhanced Compute Estimation Methods**
- **Goal**: Implement missing methodologies from Epoch AI's standard approaches
- **Deliverables**:
  - Direct reporting parser for company FLOP disclosures (Meta, OpenAI, Anthropic)
  - Hardware-based estimation (GPU/TPU specs â†’ compute calculation)
  - Enhanced scaling laws with actual training data when available
- **Success Criteria**: Improve confidence levels from "speculative" to "high" for 3-4 major models

**Priority 4: Enhanced Data Sources** 
- **Goal**: Fill remaining coverage gaps identified in validation
- **Deliverables**:
  - Company blog scrapers (technical specifications and training details)
  - Research paper scraper for academic disclosures
  - Additional leaderboard integrations as needed
- **Success Criteria**: 95%+ coverage of known >1e25 FLOP models

### Future Phase: Production Operations

**Priority 1: Reliability & Monitoring**
- **Goal**: Production-grade reliability and observability
- **Deliverables**:
  - Error handling and retry logic for all scrapers
  - Data quality monitoring and alerts
  - Automated backup and recovery procedures
  - Performance monitoring and optimization
- **Success Criteria**: 99% uptime, <1% data loss rate

**Priority 2: Automated Update Pipeline**
- **Goal**: Scheduled, hands-off operation with human oversight
- **Deliverables**:
  - Scheduled scraping with cron/GitHub Actions
  - Automated change detection and notifications
  - Daily/weekly summary reports
  - Exception handling with human escalation
- **Success Criteria**: Weekly updates with <2 hours human intervention

**Priority 3: Advanced Analytics & Reporting**
- **Goal**: Enhanced insights beyond basic model listing
- **Deliverables**:
  - Trend analysis (FLOP evolution over time)
  - Developer/organization analytics
  - Model architecture and capability tracking
  - Automated report generation
- **Success Criteria**: Rich analytical dashboard matching/exceeding current Epoch insights

## Key Design Principles

### 1. **Incremental Validation**
- Validate each enhancement against Epoch's existing data
- Maintain backward compatibility throughout development
- Test accuracy improvements continuously

### 2. **Contractor-First Design**
- Design manual processes assuming non-technical users
- Provide clear documentation and workflows
- Build validation into every manual step

### 3. **Production Reliability**
- Assume external sources will change or fail
- Build robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Design for easy maintenance and debugging

### 4. **Extensible Architecture**
- New scrapers should be easy to add
- New estimation methods should integrate seamlessly
- New output formats should be straightforward

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Coverage**: 95%+ of models in Epoch's tracker automatically detected
- **Accuracy**: FLOP estimates within 2x of known values for 90%+ of models
- **Reliability**: 99%+ uptime for scheduled operations
- **Performance**: Full data refresh in <30 minutes

### Operational Metrics
- **Manual Effort**: <2 hours/week for routine maintenance
- **Contractor Efficiency**: Non-technical user can add model in <10 minutes
- **Data Freshness**: New models detected within 7 days of public release
- **Quality**: <5% false positives/negatives in >1e25 FLOP classification

## Risk Mitigation

### Data Source Risks
- **Risk**: External sites change structure/block scraping
- **Mitigation**: Multiple fallback sources, robust error handling, monitoring

### Accuracy Risks
- **Risk**: FLOP estimates become inaccurate as methodologies evolve
- **Mitigation**: Regular validation against disclosed values, multiple estimation methods

### Operational Risks
- **Risk**: System becomes too complex for contractor management
- **Mitigation**: Extensive documentation, training materials, simple interfaces

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Performance degrades as dataset grows
- **Mitigation**: Efficient data structures, caching, incremental updates
