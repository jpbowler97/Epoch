Furthermore, by using a novel method to vertically compress the model (see details here), it also offers a significant improvement in latency.

6 * 340B * 9T = 1.8E25

alternatively, can do a hardware estimate with a few extra steps:

According to the technical report, Nemotron-4 340B was trained using up to 6144 H100 GPUs. Helpfully, they also report the model FLOP utilization (MFU), which was 41-42% (Table 2). This is the ratio of the actual output of their GPUs, in FLOP used for training, relative to their theoretical max of 989 teraFLOP/s per GPU. 
Unfortunately, the report omits the last ingredient, which is the duration of the training run. However, in Table 2 they report some relevant data that we can use to infer the training time. 
Nemotron-4 was trained in several stages, but the largest stage used all 6144 GPUs with a batch size of 2304 and an iteration time (time per batch) of 8.0 seconds. This stage involved 7.6T tokens, so it makes up the majority of training. 
A batch size of 2304 means that each batch consists of 2304 sequences, and they report that the sequence length used for training was 4096 tokens. This means that each batch contained 4096 * 2304 = 9,437,184 tokens. 
So, during this stage, it took 8 seconds to train the model on 9.4m tokens. Extrapolating to the entire 9T token dataset, this implies the training run would have taken 7,659,574 seconds, or 89 days. (it actually took longer because they didn't use all their GPUs for the whole run) 
Multiplying 7,659,574 seconds by 41% MFU, 989 peak teraFLOP/s for each H100, and 6144 H100s, we get ~1.9e25 FLOP. This is very close to our first estimate.

""We train Nemotron-4 15B on a pre-training dataset consisting of 8 trillion tokens. At a high-level,
the data blend is split into three different types of data: English natural language data (70%), multilingual

The English corpus consists of curated documents from a variety of sources and domains including web
documents, news articles, scientific papers, books, etc and the distribution used in our pre-training set is
highlighted in Figure 2. The code and multilingual data consists of a diverse set of natural and programming
languages. We find that appropriately sampling tokens from these languages is key to strong accuracies in
these domains. We share the distributions used for both code and multilingual tokens in our pre-training
dataset in Figure 3 and Figure 4 respectively.
In constructing the pre-training corpus, we remove any possible duplicates via document-level exact and
near-deduplication (Jennings et al., 2023). We additionally applied document-level quality filtering across

The high-quality alignment is achieved via a multi-stage post-training process, which involves supervised fine-tuning and learning from human feedback. Evaluations show that GLM-4 1) closely rivals or outperforms GPT-4 in terms of general metrics such as MMLU, GSM8K, MATH, BBH, GPQA, and HumanEval, 2) gets close to GPT-4-Turbo in instruction following as measured by IFEval, 3) matches GPT-4 Turbo (128K) and Claude 3 for long context tasks, and 4) outperforms GPT-4 in Chinese alignments as measured by AlignBench. The GLM-4 All Tools model is further aligned to understand user intent and autonomously decide when and which tool(s) touse -- including web browser, Python interpreter, text-to-image model, and user-defined functions -- to effectively complete complex tasks. In practical applications, it matches and even surpasses GPT-4 All Tools in tasks like accessing online information via web browsing and solving math problems using Python interpreter. Over the course, we have open-sourced a series of models, including ChatGLM-6B (three generations), GLM-4-9B (128K, 1M), GLM-4V-9B, WebGLM, and CodeGeeX, attracting over 10 million downloads on Hugging face in the year 2023 alone.

Although the field of LLM has been witnessing unprecedented advances in pushing the scale and capability of LLM in recent years, training such a large-scale model still involves significant optimization and system challenges. To stabilize the training process, we propose depth-scaled sandwich normalization, which effectively eliminates loss spikes during the training process of deep models. We pre-train our model on 13.2 trillion diverse and high-quality tokens and further enhance its reasoning capabilities during post-training. To perform such large-scale training efficiently, we utilize 8,192 Ascend NPUs with a series of system optimizations. Evaluations on multiple diverse benchmarks indicate that Pangu Ultra significantly advances the state-of-the-art capabilities of dense LLMs such as Llama 405B and Mistral Large 2, and even achieves competitive results with DeepSeek-R1, whose sparse model structure contains much more parameters. Our exploration demonstrates that Ascend NPUs are capable of efficiently and effectively training dense models with more than 100 billion parameters.
